# Horizon Resources
Modified Addons, WeakAuras and various other resources for the Horizon guild on CC.

## Addons:
- EPGP: A custom EPGP + EPGP Lootmaster version that fixes some interaction bugs between the two addons.
  Also includes proper GP calculation formula for vanilla and TBC items (both based on EPGP Classic formulae).
  Disclaimer: I am not the original author of the addons (created by https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/epgp-dkp-reloaded).

- AngryAssignments: An updated backport based on https://github.com/Vnm-Kronos/AngryAssignments.
  Adds some QoL features but otherwise no significant changes.

- DBM: There's an actively maintained DBM for CC from balleny: https://github.com/balleny/DBM.

## Weak Auras:
- A collection of useful WAs for various raids.
- If you feel like you have some useful WAs, whisper Nuari in-game and I'll post it here.

## AngryAssignments (AA) pages:
- A collection of default AA pages for Horizon raids. 
  These pages will most likely be useful only for the raid leaders, as they are the only ones able to edit and push the pages to the rest of the raiders.
  Note that the actual pages in-game might look a bit different as they will likely be polished and refined across multiple raid runs.
- *How to setup:* either copy-paste the pages content to pages created in-game or copy the `SavedVariables.lua` to `<WoW folder>/WTF/Account/<Account name>/SavedVariables`.
